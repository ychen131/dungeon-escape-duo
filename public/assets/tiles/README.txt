DUNGEON TILESET SETUP
====================

This folder contains placeholder tiles for the game. To use the beautiful Cardinal Zebra tileset:

1. Download the tileset from: https://cardinalzebra.itch.io/dungeon-tiles-1
2. Extract the "Dungeon Tiles 1.zip" file
3. Copy appropriate PNG files from the tileset and rename them to:
   - floor.png (for floor tiles)
   - wall.png (for wall tiles) 
   - fire.png (for fire hazards)
   - water.png (for water/chasm hazards)
   - exit.png (for exit tiles)

The game will automatically scale the 32x32 tileset sprites to fit the 50x50 game tiles.

If sprite files are missing, the game will fallback to colored rectangles.
