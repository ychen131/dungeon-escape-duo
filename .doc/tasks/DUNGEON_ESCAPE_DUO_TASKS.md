# Dungeon Escape Duo MVP Implementation

A 2-player cooperative puzzle game where players must communicate to solve dungeon puzzles using hidden items. This is a 5-day sprint to deliver a polished MVP with turn-based gameplay, server authority, and multiplayer networking.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Foundation & Setup âœ…

- [x] Initialize Git repository and project structure

- [x] Initialize Node.js project with npm init -y
- [x] Install required dependencies (express, socket.io)
- [x] Create basic Express server in server.js
- [x] Set up server to serve /public directory
- [x] Implement basic Socket.io connection listener
- [x] Create index.html in /public directory
- [x] Include Phaser 3 library via CDN in index.html
- [x] Include Socket.io client library in index.html
- [x] Write minimal Phaser 3 script for blank canvas
- [x] Test "Hello World" connectivity (server logs connection, client logs connected)
- [x] Create hardcoded 2D array for dungeon level layout
- [x] Implement grid rendering function using colored squares
- [x] Add visual representations for floor tiles (grey)
- [x] Add visual representations for wall tiles (dark grey)
- [x] Create player sprite placeholder (blue square)
- [x] Implement keyboard input handling (up, down, left, right)
- [x] Add player movement logic with grid constraints
- [x] Implement collision detection against walls

## In Progress Tasks

### Phase 1: Visual Client (Tuesday EOD)

- [ ] Test single-player movement and collision ðŸ”„

## Future Tasks

### Phase 2: Server Authority & Multiplayer (Wednesday EOD)

- [ ] Move 2D grid layout from client to server.js
- [ ] Move player positions from client to server state
- [ ] Implement player connection logic (assign player1/player2 IDs)
- [ ] Create game state object on server
- [ ] Send initial game state to new connecting players
- [ ] Modify client to emit moveRequest instead of direct movement
- [ ] Implement server-side moveRequest validation
- [ ] Add server-side player position updates
- [ ] Broadcast updated game state to all connected clients
- [ ] Update client rendering to use received game state
- [ ] Test two-player synchronized movement

### Phase 3: Core Puzzle Loop (Thursday EOD)

- [ ] Implement turn management system (currentPlayerTurn)
- [ ] Add server-side turn validation for requests
- [ ] Create item assignment system ("Douse Fire", "Build Bridge")
- [ ] Implement hazard tiles (Fire Hazard, Chasm)
- [ ] Add item randomization at turn start
- [ ] Create customized game state per player (hide partner's item)
- [ ] Add UI elements for current turn display
- [ ] Add UI elements for current item display
- [ ] Implement "Use Item" keybind and client handling
- [ ] Add server-side useItemRequest validation
- [ ] Implement item effects (fire removal, bridge building)
- [ ] Add turn switching after item use or movement
- [ ] Test turn-based puzzle mechanics

### Phase 4: Polish & Shipping (Friday EOD)

- [ ] Add "Exit" tile type to grid system
- [ ] Implement win condition (both players on exit tiles)
- [ ] Create 2-3 hardcoded level layouts
- [ ] Add level progression system after wins
- [ ] Implement "Waiting for partner..." UI state
- [ ] Add "Player X's Turn" UI indicators
- [ ] Create "You Win!" screen
- [ ] Add level transition screens ("Level 2", etc.)
- [ ] Implement graceful player disconnection handling
- [ ] Add error handling and edge case management
- [ ] **Stretch Goal**: Replace placeholder art with pixel sprites
- [ ] **Stretch Goal**: Add sound effects and background music
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

**Server Authority Model**: The Node.js server maintains the master game state and validates all player actions. The client is purely for rendering and input collection.

**Communication Flow**:
1. Client sends input requests to server
2. Server validates and updates master state
3. Server broadcasts updated state to all clients
4. Clients re-render based on received state

### Key Technical Components

1. **Server-Side Game State**:
   - Grid layout (2D array)
   - Player positions and IDs
   - Current turn management
   - Item assignments per player
   - Win condition tracking

2. **Client-Side Rendering**:
   - Phaser 3 game engine
   - Grid visualization
   - Player sprites
   - UI elements (turn indicators, item display)

3. **Networking Protocol**:
   - Socket.io for real-time communication
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Custom game state per player (hidden information)

### Data Flow

```
Player Input â†’ Client â†’ Socket.io â†’ Server Validation â†’ State Update â†’ Broadcast â†’ All Clients â†’ Re-render
```

### Core Game Loop

1. Player's turn begins â†’ Server assigns random item
2. Server sends customized state (showing only player's own item)
3. Player chooses: Move OR Use Item
4. Server validates action and updates master state
5. Server broadcasts new state to all clients
6. Turn switches to other player
7. Repeat until win condition met
