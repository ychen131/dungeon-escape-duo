## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

**Server Authority Model**: The Node.js server maintains the master game state and validates all player actions. The client is purely for rendering and input collection.

**Communication Flow**:
1. Client sends input requests to server
2. Server validates and updates master state
3. Server broadcasts updated state to all clients
4. Clients re-render based on received state

### Key Technical Components

1. **Server-Side Game State** ✅:
   - Grid layout (2D array) stored on server
   - Player positions and IDs managed server-side
   - Connection management with proper player slot assignment
   - Real-time state synchronization via Socket.io

2. **Client-Side Rendering** ✅:
   - Phaser 3 game engine for visualization
   - Dynamic grid and player sprite rendering
   - Real-time player join/leave handling
   - Move request system (no local game logic)

3. **Networking Protocol** ✅:
   - Socket.io for real-time communication
   - Event-driven architecture with moveRequest/gameState events
   - Connection rejection for full games
   - Graceful reconnection handling

### Phase 2 Implementation Details

**Server Architecture**:
- Master game state object with players dictionary
- `findAvailablePlayerSlot()` function for robust player management
- Server-side movement validation (bounds checking, collision detection)
- Proper disconnect handling that preserves remaining players

**Client Architecture**:
- Server-state driven rendering (no local game state)
- Dynamic sprite creation/destruction for joining/leaving players
- Real-time position updates via `updateGameRendering()`
- Connection status management with user feedback

**Bug Fixes Implemented**:
1. **Player Refresh Issue**: Rewrote player management to use specific slots instead of counters
2. **Connection Rejection**: Added proper timing and flag handling for "Game is full" message
3. **Real-time Joining**: Enhanced `updateGameRendering()` to create sprites for new players dynamically

**Phase 3 Implementation Details**:

**Turn-Based Gameplay**:
- `currentPlayerTurn` and `gameStarted` state management
- Server-side turn validation (only current player can act)
- Automatic turn switching after moves or item usage
- Visual turn indicators with color coding (green/orange)

**Item & Hazard System**:
- Two item types: "Douse Fire" and "Build Bridge"
- Two hazard types: Fire Hazard (red tiles) and Chasm (purple tiles)
- Random item assignment when game starts and after item usage
- Customized game state (players can't see partner's items)

**Puzzle Mechanics**:
- Items affect adjacent tiles (up/down/left/right from player)
- "Douse Fire" removes fire hazards, "Build Bridge" fills chasms
- Hazards converted to walkable floor tiles when items used
- SPACEBAR key for item usage with full validation

**Cooperative Elements**:
- Hidden information (secret item assignments)
- Need communication to coordinate item usage
- Turn-based strategy requiring planning ahead

**Robust Starting Position System**:
- `ensureSafeStartingPositions()` validates map on server startup
- Automatically converts any hazards on starting tiles to safe floor tiles
- Preserves intended starting positions while ensuring player safety
- Future-proof for new levels and map modifications

### Data Flow

```
Player Input → Client → Socket.io → Server Validation → State Update → Broadcast → All Clients → Re-render
```

### Core Game Loop (Phase 3 Target)

1. Player's turn begins → Server assigns random item
2. Server sends customized state (showing only player's own item)
3. Player chooses: Move OR Use Item
4. Server validates action and updates master state
5. Server broadcasts new state to all clients
6. Turn switches to other player
7. Repeat until win condition met

## Phase 2 Testing Status ✅

**Multiplayer Functionality**:
- ✅ Two players can connect and see each other immediately
- ✅ Real-time synchronized movement for both players
- ✅ Server-side collision detection and bounds checking
- ✅ Player refresh/reconnection works correctly
- ✅ Third player properly rejected with clear message
- ✅ Graceful disconnect handling preserves remaining player

**Ready for Phase 3 Implementation!** 

## Post-MVP Bug Fixes

### Game Completion Logic Fix ✅
- [x] **Bug Fix**: Fixed game to properly end after Level 2 completion instead of continuing indefinitely
  - Modified `advanceToNextLevel()` function to check for Level 2 completion
  - Added `gameCompleted` flag to game state for final victory state
  - Updated client UI to show epic final victory screen for game completion
  - Ensured input is disabled during final completion state
  - Added distinct visual effects for final victory vs level completion
  - Game now properly ends after both levels are mastered

**Result**: Game now has proper 2-level structure with final completion instead of infinite progression!
