# Dungeon Escape Duo MVP Implementation

A 2-player cooperative puzzle game where players must communicate to solve dungeon puzzles using hidden items. This is a 5-day sprint to deliver a polished MVP with turn-based gameplay, server authority, and multiplayer networking.

- [ ] **Stretch Goal**: Replace placeholder art with pixel sprites
- [ ] **Stretch Goal**: Add sound effects and background music
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

**Server Authority Model**: The Node.js server maintains the master game state and validates all player actions. The client is purely for rendering and input collection.

**Communication Flow**:
1. Client sends input requests to server
2. Server validates and updates master state
3. Server broadcasts updated state to all clients
4. Clients re-render based on received state

### Key Technical Components

1. **Server-Side Game State** ✅:
   - Grid layout (2D array) stored on server
   - Player positions and IDs managed server-side
   - Connection management with proper player slot assignment
   - Real-time state synchronization via Socket.io

2. **Client-Side Rendering** ✅:
   - Phaser 3 game engine for visualization
   - Dynamic grid and player sprite rendering
   - Real-time player join/leave handling
   - Move request system (no local game logic)

3. **Networking Protocol** ✅:
   - Socket.io for real-time communication
   - Event-driven architecture with moveRequest/gameState events
   - Connection rejection for full games
   - Graceful reconnection handling

### Phase 2 Implementation Details

**Server Architecture**:
- Master game state object with players dictionary
- `findAvailablePlayerSlot()` function for robust player management
- Server-side movement validation (bounds checking, collision detection)
- Proper disconnect handling that preserves remaining players

**Client Architecture**:
- Server-state driven rendering (no local game state)
- Dynamic sprite creation/destruction for joining/leaving players
- Real-time position updates via `updateGameRendering()`
- Connection status management with user feedback

**Bug Fixes Implemented**:
1. **Player Refresh Issue**: Rewrote player management to use specific slots instead of counters
2. **Connection Rejection**: Added proper timing and flag handling for "Game is full" message
3. **Real-time Joining**: Enhanced `updateGameRendering()` to create sprites for new players dynamically

### Data Flow

```
Player Input → Client → Socket.io → Server Validation → State Update → Broadcast → All Clients → Re-render
```

### Core Game Loop (Phase 3 Target)

1. Player's turn begins → Server assigns random item
2. Server sends customized state (showing only player's own item)
3. Player chooses: Move OR Use Item
4. Server validates action and updates master state
5. Server broadcasts new state to all clients
6. Turn switches to other player
7. Repeat until win condition met
