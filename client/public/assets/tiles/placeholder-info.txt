PLACEHOLDER TILES INFO
=====================

The game will work with either:

1. REAL TILESET: Download from https://cardinalzebra.itch.io/dungeon-tiles-1
   - Extract the ZIP and copy 5 PNG files (rename to: floor.png, wall.png, fire.png, water.png, exit.png)

2. FALLBACK MODE: No sprites needed!
   - If PNG files are missing, the game automatically shows colored rectangles
   - This lets you test the game structure without downloading anything

The server is now running at: http://localhost:3000

Current status: FALLBACK MODE (colored rectangles) - game is fully functional!
