[[2D Game Terminology]]

### Initial ideas:
- Games that spins of famous IP: animal crossing, Witcher, Squid Game and etc
- Games make existing board games into desktop game, eg Ark Nova
- Quiz and Puzzles game on the desktop
- provided type of games I love: AAA combating games, strategical co-op games

Final Decision:
#### **Dungeon Escape Duo (Turn-Based Co-op Puzzle)**
[[Dungeon Escape Duo]]

- **Number of Players:**
    
    - **Multiplayer:** 2 players cooperating.
        
    - **Single-Player:** **Awkward.** You would have to control both players, taking turns as each one. Good for testing the puzzle, but not an engaging solo experience.
        
- **Core Difficulty: Medium**
    
    - The primary challenge is **State Management**. The server must perfectly track the "board state"—every player's position, their inventory, and the state of every tile on the grid—and ensure every move is valid. It's a logic and accounting challenge.
        
- **Progression System: Game Leveling**
    
    - Progression is achieved by creating a series of **unique puzzle rooms**.
        
    - **Level 1:** A simple tutorial room.
        
    - **Level 2:** A more complex room requiring a specific sequence of moves.
        
    - **Level 3:** A master puzzle that requires clever planning and communication.
