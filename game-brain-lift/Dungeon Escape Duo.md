We have a single-screen, grid-based room. Two players need to get from the entrance to the exit. The room is filled with hazards, like a fire wall or a chasm. On each turn, players are given one random "action" card, like "Douse Fire," "Build Bridge," or "Push Block." They can only hold one card at a time and must use their actions to clear a path for each other. Each player's action is hidden from each other this force them to communicate during remote playing. 

#### **Component 1: The Game State (The Server's Brain)**

This is the "single source of truth" for our game.

- **The Grid:** We'll represent the world as a 2D array, let's say 10 tiles wide by 8 tiles high.
    
    - **Tile Types:** For our first version, we need a basic set. How does this list sound?
        
        - `0`: Floor (walkable)
            
        - `1`: Wall (blocks movement)
            
        - `2`: Fire Hazard (blocks movement, can be doused)
            
        - `3`: Chasm (blocks movement, can be bridged)
            
        - `4`: Player 1 Start
            
        - `5`: Player 2 Start
            
        - `6`: Exit
            
- **Player Info:** We'll track the `(x, y)` coordinates for each player. For example: `player1_position = {x: 1, y: 1}`.
    
- **Turn Management:** A simple variable, like `current_turn = "player1"`, that flips back and forth.
    
- **Player "Hands" (Action Cards):** This is the core puzzle mechanic. Each player holds one action card at a time.
    
    - **Proposed Action Cards:**
        
        - `"douse_fire"`: Can be used on a `Fire Hazard` tile to turn it into a `Floor` tile.
            
        - `"build_bridge"`: Can be used on a `Chasm` tile to turn it into a `Floor` tile.
            
    - _Question for you:_ Should players be given these cards randomly each turn, or should they find them on the map? Starting with a random card each turn is simpler to build.
        

#### **Component 2: Player Actions (The Rules)**

These are the only two things a player can do on their turn.

1. **Move:** The player chooses a direction (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`). The server checks if the destination tile is valid (i.e., not a wall, fire, or chasm). If it's valid, the server updates that player's coordinates.
    
2. **Use Action:** The player chooses to use their held Action Card on an adjacent tile. The server checks if the action is valid (e.g., you can't use `"douse_fire"` on a `Chasm`). If it's valid, the server updates the grid itself.
    

After either a valid move or a valid action, the turn ends, and it becomes the other player's turn.

#### **Component 3: The Visuals (The Client)**

This is what we'll build in Phaser 3. It's a "dumb" representation of the server's Game State.

- **Render the Board:** The client will receive the 2D grid from the server and draw the correct colored square for each tile type.
    
- **Draw Players:** It will draw the player sprites at the coordinates received from the server.
    
- **Display UI:** It will show whose turn it is and display the Action Card each player is currently holding.
